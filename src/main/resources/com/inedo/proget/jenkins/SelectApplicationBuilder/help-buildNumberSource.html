<div>
  <p>Select which build number to use to populate the BUILDMASTER_BUILD_NUMBER environment variable:  
  <ul>
  	<li>Jenkins: use the Jenkins build number</li>
  	<li>BuildMaster: determine which build number BuildMaster will use next.</li>
  	<li>Not Required: don't care what build number BuildMaster uses and we'll each do our own thing - BUILDMASTER_BUILD_NUMBER will not be populated</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>TIP: If have multiple Jenkins jobs triggering the one BuildMaster application build then use "Not Required", otherwise
    you are likely to run into a timing issue with the build numbers. 
    </i>
